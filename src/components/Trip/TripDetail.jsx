                        An island is a body of land surrounded by water.
                        Continents are also surrounded by water, but because
                        they are so big, they are not considered islands.
                        Australia, the smallest continent, is more than three
                        times the size of Greenland, the largest island. There
                        are countless islands in the ocean, lakes, and rivers
                        around the world. They vary greatly in size, climate,
                        and the kinds of organisms that inhabit them.
